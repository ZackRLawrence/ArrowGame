Arrows are in fact firable from an in fact rotatable crossbow.
Arrows will stick to what they hit with the head of the arrow, and targets will 
be completed if hit by the head of an arrow. I opted for a first person camera, which was
not my original intention.

There are actually 4 levels set up. All pretty simple as stated but I'm further along
along here than I expected to be.

Temp art assets galore. I've custom terrains in every level, a cute pastel green and brown
texturing to them, prototype crossbow, a prototype arrow, and a maybe prototype/maybe final target.
Honestly I'm quite enjoying the aesthetic I have so far to the point where I'm considering 
completely keeping it.

Sounds effects are not in as of yet. The sound room on campus was taken tonight so  I instead opted to pull
ahead on other things, in particular:

The projectile path prediction is actually comepletely finished, meaning I'm very far ahead of
my predictions for this check in leaving a stretch goal open as a possibility. VR is my first choice.

An unexpected task was implementing a terrain generator I wrote. I've found it to be by far the best option
for easily creating believable enough landscapes with enough control to design levels.

There were also plenty of fixes required through the process involving physics and arrows resizing when
sticking to objects.
